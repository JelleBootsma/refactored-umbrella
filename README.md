# refactored-umbrella
Test site I can use to test stuff and use to fork when i need to create a website for some reason
Uses HTML, CSS and JQuery, so a bit outdated, but well tested. It is also hosted on Heroku, by using the static HTML buildpack

The site is for now filled with open stock images, but these are just placeholders.
