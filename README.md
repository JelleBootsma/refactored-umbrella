Test site I can use to test stuff and use to fork when i need to create a website for some reason
Uses HTML, CSS and JQuery, so a bit outdated, but well tested. The PHP is just there to be able to host it on Heroku

The site is for now filled with open stock images, but these are just placeholders.
